        <h4 class="noodleh4">Description</h4>
            <p>noodle, a cooked egg-and-flour paste prominent in European and Asian cuisine, generally distinguished from pasta by its elongated ribbonlike form.<br> Noodles are commonly used to add body and flavour to broth soups.<br> They are commonly boiled or sautéed and served with sauces and meats or baked in casseroles.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tbsp teriyaki sauce</li>
                <li>½ tsp Chinese five-spice powder</li>
                <li>2 tsp medium Madras curry powder</li>
                <li>300g/11oz pork tenderloin, trimmed of any fat</li>
                <li>140g medium egg noodle</li>
                <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
                <li>2 x 300g packs fresh mixed stir-fry vegetables</li>
                <li>100g cooked prawn, thawed if frozen</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the teriyaki sauce, five-spice and curry powders. <br>Add half to the pork, turning to coat, and leave to marinate for 15 mins.</li>
                <li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. Remove pork from the marinade and put on a small baking tray lined with foil.<br> Roast for 15-20 mins.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, cook the noodles following pack instructions, but reduce the cooking time by 1 min.<br> Refresh in cold water and drain very well.</li>
                <li>Transfer the pork to a chopping board and rest for 5 mins. Set a large non-stick frying pan or wok over a medium-high heat. Add the oil and stir-fry the veg for 3-4 mins. <br>Cut the pork in half lengthways, then thinly slice. Tip into the pan, with the prawns, noodles and remaining marinade. <br>Toss together for 2-3 mins until hot.</li>
